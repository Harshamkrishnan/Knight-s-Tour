# Knight-s-Tour
Knight can move either two squares horizontally and one square vertically or two squares vertically and one square horizontally in each direction, So the complete movement looks like English letter ‘L’. If the knight visited every squares in the chess board once then we can call it as knight's tour. This code solves the problem using Back Tracking algorithm.
